# hapi-validation-question

Hapi.js Validation with Joi + `failAction` question.

I'm trying to *understand* how to avoid returning a "*raw*" `400`
error to the client on validation error:

Please see the code in `server.js`.

I asked the question on GitHub: https://github.com/hapijs/joi/issues/725
